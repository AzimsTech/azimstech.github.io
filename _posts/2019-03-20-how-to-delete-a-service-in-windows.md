Find Services You Want to Delete
====================================

Open Services same as opening command prompt by hitting the Start menu and start searching "services" and click on it.

In my case, I want to delete a couple of Adobe services. So I need to find its "short service name" by doing this.

Start Typing These Command 
====================================

Now you need to start typing these two commands:

~~~
SC STOP shortservicename
SC DELETE shortservicename
~~~

Remember to replace "shortsercivename" to your desired service name that you have copied last time. 

Im my case:
~~~
SC STOP AGMService
SC DELETE AGMService
~~~

Bonus Tips
====================================

If you need to find the short service name of a service, use the following command to generate a text file containing a list of services and their statuses:

~~~
SC QUERY state= all >"C:\Service List.txt"
~~~
