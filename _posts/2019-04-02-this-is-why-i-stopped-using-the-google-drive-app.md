If you are frequent **Google Drive** user, the app I will introduced to you will save you hundreds of hours. Unlike the official Google Drive app, you can manage your offline files in your phone as well as files in your Google Drive account in one place by using this app.

Introducing MiXplorer 
=====================
So what is **MiXplorer**? **MiXplorer** is a fully featured Android file manager developed by **Hootan Parsa**. If you like to know the full list of features of this app can offer you can see it from the official website [here](https://mixplorer.com/#intro).

How I Add My Google Drive Account
=================================
Here the demonstration of how I add my **Google Drive account** into the app:

{% include embed/youtube.html id='At32r148_RY' %}

Thanks to this app now I can **copy and paste** my files back and forth from my Android device without any hassle.

{% include embed/youtube.html id='xBPMgYm2o44' %}

This is a demo on how I get the **shareable link** of my selected file from my Google Drive storage.

{% include embed/youtube.html id='h9_nWvI72aU' %}

As you can see this app precisely do the most of thing that Google Drive app would do but **4x faster** which is a huge plus for me.

Where do I get it?
===================
If you are interested you can download yourself the app from the original **XDA forum** post or the mirror links down below.

You also can support the developer by purchasing the **MiXplorer Silver** from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mixplorer.silver).
Note that the difference between the free and paid version of this app is not significant.
