In Malaysia, unlimited data plans don’t really mean unlimited. Apart from the ridiculously low 3Mbps data caps, they also introduce the very famous “fair usage policy” (FUP).

It’s almost like a bunch of them sit around in a meeting room and agree that speed caps and FUP must be set at certain amounts and prices. It’s almost like price fixing.

Anyway, there’s nothing we can do about this as consumers except to choose the least painful option out of the bunch. And yes, of course, they have made it difficult to find detailed information to compare.

Here’s why I’m making one here:

| Plan			| Speed   	| FUP       | Pricing   | Details                       |
